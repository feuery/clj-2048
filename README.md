# clj-2048

A Clojure port of the famous [2048-game](http://git.io/2048). Written in a single night's boost of inspiration.

## Usage

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/feuery/clj-2048/releases) - page. As the binary is a java-binary, the same package works for every pc os.

After you've extracted the zip, run the game either by calling 'java -jar ./path/to/jarfile.jar' or double clicking it in you file GUI of choice.

Game makes a conf file full of executable clojure in the user.home/.clj-2048. I sincerely encourage you to hack it.
